Congrats, %name! 

All graduated and signed up for your shift time, that's HUGE! 

Your first shift is %date

Here are a few pro tips to help you rock your first shift:

- Your supervisor's name is on the upper left corner of your screen (say hello!)
- Enter your status under your name (suggestion: "First Shift" - or some funky version of this, so your fellow crisis counselors know to say hello!)
- Only take 1 conversation at a time
- NEVER feel like you are alone, your peers and supervisors are there to help!
- Say hi to everyone in the Global Chat let them know you are new - join the convo (it's a fun crew!)
- If you aren't able to make your first shift, please request time off using the scheduling tool.

You passed training. You have all of the tools and knowledge you need to be a great crisis counselor - you got this!

Enjoy your first shift,
The Crisis Text Line Training Team
