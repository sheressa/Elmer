Thanks for signing up for your weekly four hours on the platform! Because of YOU we're supporting more and more texters each day.

Got some extra time to spare? You can take up to 12 hours of shift time each week (you're capped at 12 because we want you to practice self-care!). Log back into the scheduling tool to set up another shift: https://online.crisistextline.org/user/login?destination=schedule

Cheers,
The Crisis Text Line Team
