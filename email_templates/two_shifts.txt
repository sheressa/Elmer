Hey there,

We're so psyched that you're signed up for your weekly four hours. But we're excited to have you on board, so we'd like to extend the offer of taking another shift to you.

If you'd like to, you can head over to https://online.crisistextline.org/user/login?destination=wiw/schedule to sign up for an extra weekly shift.

Thanks!
