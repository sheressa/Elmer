Currently, it extends the functionality of our scheduling app [WhenIWork](http://wheniwork.com/) by supporting our custom use cases. Quite generally--among other functionality--it supports:\r\n\r\n1. single sign-on through online.crisistextline.org\r\n2. sending custom emails to users when they've successfully scheduled shifts\r\n3. recurring shifts weekly\r\n4. coloring shifts\r\n5. deleting shifts\r\n\r\n## Running on local\r\nRun `npm install`. In your main directory, `touch keys.js`. Copy-and-paste the contents of `keys.js.default` into the new key file. Add requisite API keys.\r\n\r\nCheck out `package.json`. Note that `npm start` runs the app when in production, which really runs two separate processes:\r\n\r\n1. runs scheduling cronjobs\r\n2. runs Express routes which handle shift scheduling, deletion, single-sign-on / user creation, and timezone validation.\r\n\r\nWe split out these functions into two separate processes for more stability--if an API call returns that throws an exception, only one process will restart with `[forever](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever)`.\r\n\r\nDuring development, we generally run each process separately, either running `node ./www/app.js` or `node ./runJobs.js`. Note that if no `NODE_ENV` specified, the environment is running in `develop` by default.\r\n\r\nThis app runs on Node 6.6.2.\r\n\r\n## Running on production\r\n\r\nThere's a Jenkins continuous integration job set up that allows for instant deploys from the master branch of this repo.\r\n\r\nThe Jenkins job runs the following:\r\n\r\n`NODE_ENV=production PORT=80 forever npm start`\r\n\r\n## Style\r\nThis repo will abide by [AirBnB's Ecmascript 5 standards](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/es5).\r\n",
